        <h1>TEMPERATURE AND ITS MEASUREMENT</h1>
        <img src="balaswechalogo.png" id="logo">
        <p id="p1">We wear our clothes according to tempearture right!Likw we wear woolen
             clothes and dark coloured clothes during winter because they provide us warmth
            and we prefer to wear light coloured and cotton clothes during summer.Not only clothes
        we also prefer food according to temperature like we eat icecream in summer and 
    have a hot cup of tea in winter or rainy seasons.And when it comes to objects
or food items we can touch and say that whether they are hot or cold-hot milk
,chair kept under sun,icecream,fruit juice,...But when it comes to other objects that
we cannot just tell they are hot or cold by touch or feel we need to know the 
temperature by measuring it...</p>
