        <h1 >THERMOMETER</h1>
        <p id="p1">Themometer is used to measure the temperature of an object.Galileo invented a rudimentary water thermometer in 1593.He called this device a thermoscope.However,this form was effective as water freezed at low temperatures.In 1714,Gabriel Fahrenheit invented the modern mercury thermometer.
            A thermometer consists of a long,narrow,uniform glass tube called the stem.The scales in which the temperature is measured are marked on the stem.At the end of the stem, there is a small bulb which contains mercury in it.A capillary tube is inside the glass stem in ehich mercury expands when the  bulb is kept contact with a hot body.
        </p>
         <h2>
            Why mercury is used inside thermometer?     
         </h2>
         <p id="p2">  Mercury is the only one in liquid state at room temperature.It’s used in thermometers because it has high coefficient of expansion.
            Hence,the slighest change in temperature is notable when it’s used in a thermometer.It also has a high boiling point which makes it very suitable to measure higher temperatures.Also,it has a shiny appearance and doesn’t stick to the surface of glass.</p>
        <h2 id="h2">Problems with using mercury thermometers</h2>
        <ul id="ul"><li>It cannot measure very low temperature because its freezing oint is high.</li>
            <li>Its price is high.</li>
            <li>Display is harder to read.</li>
            <li>slow response.</li>
            <li>Mercury is poisonous.</li>
        </ul>                                          
        <p id="p3">Mercury is toxic,and it is very difficult to dispose it when the thermometer breaks.So,nowadays digital thermometers are used to measure the thermometers ,as they do not contain mercury.</p>
